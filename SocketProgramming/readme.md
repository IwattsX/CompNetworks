SOCKET PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT

I want you to create an example programming project that simulates a client/server connection.



# INSTRUCTIONS
Using Python, write a client and server program that uses either UDP or TCP

Examples might include:

An example of client and server code is provided in Code for Class
You may use ChatGPT to help you sketch out an idea
